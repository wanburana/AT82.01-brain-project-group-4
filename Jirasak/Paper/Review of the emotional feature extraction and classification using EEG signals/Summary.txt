Summary    
This paper review the detail of EEG data analysis, from description and meaning of each power band, to  feature extraction method, as well as the classification model used  
Extracting only power sprectrum can be quick and easy, but requied a lot of domain knowledge otherwise a lot of information is lost. Nowadays there are more sophisticated method to extract the information. Here are some of the interesting methods  
- More well-known
    - Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)
    - Power Spectral Density (PSD)
    - Wavelet Transform (WT)
    - Differential Entropy (DE)
    - Empirical mode decomposition (EMD)
- More Advance
    - dynamic differential entropy (DDE): combined the advantages of the EMD and DE
    - dual tree-complex wavelet transform (DT-CWT): good anti-aliasing effect and translation invariance, compared to traditional wavelet transform
    - DE-PCCM: combined DE and Pearson correlation coefficient matrix (PCCM), can measure the correlation between different brain nodes in different emotional states
- Other (High Accuracy)
    - Adaptive Tunable Q Wavelet Transform (ATQWT)
    - Smoothed Pseudo Wigner Ville Distribution (SPWVD)


Interesting Notes 
- wavelet packet transform (WPT) and Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) are also important methods of time-frequency domain analysis
- dynamic empirical convolutional neural network (DECNN) algorithm is used, and the classification accuracy is 97.56%
- a deep forest-based model achieved average accuracy of valence and arousal reach 97.69% and 97.53% (Proposed to overcome shortcoming of excessive parameters and large amount data)
- L. Yang et al. proposed a sequence model based on deep learning to construct a time sequence of fixed length time window data and input it into a temporal convolutional network to solve the problem that the EEG signals are dependent on time
- B. H. Kim et al. [89] proposed a model based on convolutional long and short-term memory networks and a loss function based on
time edges. The DEAP public dataset experiment showed that the recognition accuracy was improved by 15.96%
